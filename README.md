# My Basic Programming Exercises

This repository contains folders with small programs written of learning and improving my basic understanding of programming skills.

## Learning Journey

In my Bachelor's studies, I dabbled in writing some code in ``C++``. I wasn't really into it, so that led me to explore different interests during education. Occasionally, I would motivate myself to do some coding stuff (even briefly considered another language, like ``Java``), but I gave up after a few days of trying.

After a significant break following my first and last freelance job in my career, I rekindled my interest in programming by starting my **learning journey** with ``Python`` through the Android app called ["Mimo"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getmimo). Over the course of a month, this learning experience helped me grasp the fundamentals of programming.

Now, I'm using the web version of [Mimo](https://mimo.org/), which is currently in beta, but it seems to be a valuable tool for improving my knowledge of specific programming languages (despite some occasional issues with the exercises).

Of course, **ChatGPT & Bing Chat** is always up there to assist me whenever I encounter difficulties in understanding code.
